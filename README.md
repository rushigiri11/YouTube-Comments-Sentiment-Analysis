# YouTube-Comments-Sentiment-Analysis
This project is a GUI application built with Python's `tkinter` that performs sentiment analysis on comments from a specified YouTube video. The application retrieves comments using the YouTube Data API, cleans the comments, analyzes their sentiment, checks for profanity, and visualizes the results with pie and bar charts.
